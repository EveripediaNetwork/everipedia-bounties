# ðŸ’¸ Everipedia Bounties

Everipedia is excited to announce the opening of a public bounty system for the IQ ecosystem, with up to $4,000 per task and a total of $15,000 available in our first batch.

## ðŸ¤‘ How it works?

1. Check our bounties in [the GitHub issues](https://github.com/EveripediaNetwork/everipedia-bounties/issues).
2. Comment in our telegram channel if you have questions or want to work on a bounty ( https://t.me/epbounties ).
3. You must discuss with us before starting a bounty. Do this by commenting on a github issue and/or a message to the team on Telegram. Only one developer can work on a bounty at once.
4. Work on the bounty and communicate with the Everipedia team. Ensure you're talking to us often so your PR will be what we expect.
5. Create a Pull Request and include your EOS mainnet account name in the PR comment.
6. Get accepted Pull Request.
7. Get paid in IQ with the dollar equivalence of the current day of merging the PR.

### Accepting the pull request

The Everipedia team will review your Pull Request. We expect high quality of code, test coverage, and code available to be deployed on Kylin & Mainnet. If you have questions please reach to us in the telegram channel created for EP Bounties.

### Locking

We will lock the issue once a developer is accepted. We expect weekly / bi-weekly communication about updates, code pushes. If developer fails to communicate / is not engaging with the locked task, Everipedia Team can open it again for other developers.
